Task 1
For this task, you will be creating a temperature metric converter.

● Create a new JavaScript file in this folder called temperature.js.

● Write the code that will do the following:

The user should be allowed to choose which calculation they want to do. The first output that the user sees when the program runs should say:
In which metric is the temperature you are converting?

C - Celsius

F - Fahrenheit

K - Kelvin

The user should then be asked to input the number they want to convert.

Next, the user should choose what they want to convert their current temperature to. For example:

To which metric would you like to convert the temperature?

C - Celsius

F - Fahrenheit

K - Kelvin

The program should print out the answer in the following format:
-273°C is 0K.

The program should be able to convert from any of the three metrics to any of the three metrics.
Conversion formulae:

Celsius from:
○ Fahrenheit: C = (F -32) x 5/9

○ Kelvin: C = K - 273.15

Fahrenheit from:
○ Celsius: F = C x 9/5 + 32

○ Kelvin: F = k x 9/5 - 459.67

Kelvin from:
○ Celsius: K = C + 273.15

○ Fahrenheit: K = (F + 459.67) x 5/9
